  Each incorrect guess displays a new part of the stick figure — a visual representation of your remaining lives.

- ✅ **Repeated Guess Detection**  
  The game notifies the user if a letter has already been guessed.

- 🔄 **Live Word Update**  
  After each guess, the placeholder updates to reveal correct letters.

- ☠️ **Loss Condition**  
  The player loses if the hangman is fully drawn (7 incorrect guesses).
